  <summary>Open-source framework for IoT edge computing</summary>
  <description><![CDATA[
EdgeX Foundry is a vendor-neutral, highly flexible and scalable open-source framework hosted by The Linux Foundation. It enables developers to build apps that run at the edge, acting as a middleware between the things and the cloud.

It provides the components to develop microservices responsible for data acquisition, data analytics and cloud connectors, exposing a rich set of APIs to allow full control of the system and configuration. The reference architecture allows scaling out to thousands of devices and sensors.

This snap is a part of EdgeX Foundry and contains the following reference services:

**Core Services**
* Core Data and Message Bus (Redis)
* Core Command
* Core Metadata
* Registry and Config (Consul)

**Supporting Services**
* Rules Engine (eKuiper)
* Scheduling
* Alerts & Notifications

**Application Services**
* Configurable Application Service

**Security Services**
* API Gateway a.k.a. Reverse Proxy (Kong)
* Secret Store (Vault)

**Management Services**
* Management Service Agent (deprecated)

**Device Services**
* Virtual

Note that not all the above services are enabled and started by default.
